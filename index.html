<p>This is one of the best free things to do in Lake Atitlán because every town sits right on the lake so you have prime sunset or sunrise viewing from every single town. Depending on the direction the town faces, some towns are better for certain times of the day.<br>
    <br>
    Panajachel and Santa Catarina are perfect for sunset, as you have a stunning view of all the volcanoes directly across the lake. San Marcos is in the perfect spot for sunrise because it faces towards the east.<br><br> 
    
    But from any town, if the sun rising or setting is particularly mesmerizing, which often happens after thunderstorms in the evening, then you can enjoy a lovely view from anywhere on the lake. Just head out towards the water, set up camp on a dock or on the water's edge and take in the views.<img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTjsASC_nEGs4DfVKB65Ab0UbKdxP2rBmjpTg&usqp=CAU"alt="image of sunset at the lake"width="300">

<p>One of the best things to do in Lake Atitlan when you arrive is to grab a kayak and paddle out into the middle of the lake. It’s the perfect way to get your bearings and to realize just how small you are inside this massive volcanic crater lake.</p><img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSKQGkgKupFaYQKOpyYQ_5LRHoQgny6LWEZ9g&usqp=CAU" alt="image of a man kayaking on the lake" weight="300">

It’s a great way to spend your time when looking for what to do in Lake Atitlan. <br><br>The most popular villages to visit are San Juan, San Marcos, Santa Cruz, and Panajachel, each offering a different vibe and experience from the last. <br><br>

<p class="hi"id="night">SPEND NIGHT IN SANTA CRUZ</p><img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRktql4pn9t95umBAVhaMt8CHs-ZiA1wXaptQ&usqp=CAU" alt="image of santa cruz" weight="300"><p>If you want to relax and unwind with stunning views on your doorstep then this is the perfect place to do so!<br><br> If you have the time, I highly recommend spending a night over on the opposite side of the lake in Santa Cruz. It’s a more peaceful vibe than San Pedro and you won’t find much more here than a few small restaurants and lakeside resorts.<br><br> <img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRmE6WB0v_heb4r-EG7Jjh7LZHIJMWpRAxKqQ&usqp=CAU" alt="two canopy on docks along lake atitlan" weight="300"> <br><br> Rooms available at Atitlan Sunset Lodge are fully furnished apartments with a kitchen, fridge, dining and living area, sun terrace, large comfortable beds, and private bathrooms. The best part is the million-dollar view of the lake through the window and Volcán San Pedro looms in the background!<br> <img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSBFYk77AxWDeByeHzlEKo5XqnVkHjpzYEyHQ&usqp=CAU"alt="image of santa cruz hotel" weight="309"> <br><br> Other features at this epic accommodation are a hot tub, chair swing on the end of the pier, and kayaks available for all guests to use free of charge.

  <p class="hi" id="nose">HIKE TO THE INDIAN NOSE VIEWPOINT</p><img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQ892-KdGY5Uh_d4eHOCwCcb4w9WQ44euiRTg&usqp=CAU"alt="image ot the indian nose ring"weight="300"><br><p>Another one of the most unmissable things to do in Lake Atitlan is to hike to the Indian Nose viewpoint (La Nariz) for sunrise, boasting panoramic views of the entire crater lake and its surrounding villages. Indian Nose is the most popular short hike among tourists visiting Lago Atitlan, taking only 30 to 40 minutes to reach the top.<br><br>Indian Nose mountain is located in San Juan, the next village across the lake from the more popular town of San Pedro. The mountain is easily distinguished from a distance when you tilt your head horizontally, revealing a Mayan face with a large pointy nose.<img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcR7E3eXJVY0CPCxRs1ahjygbxTxURPWtXpyOg&usqp=CAU"alt="image ot the indian nose ring"weight="300"><br> <br>Climbing to the summit of Indian Nose takes no more than 30 to 40 minutes for the average person and the view from the top is absolutely breathtaking. Watch the sun as it rises over the rim of the crater and fills the lake with its beaming rays!<br><br><img src="https://www.jonnymelon.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/lake-atitlan-guatemala-41-800x600.jpg" alt="image of sunrise at indian nose" weight="300">

Aside from just swimming and walking along the water, there are lots of water sports where you can get a good workout while admiring the amazing view around you.<br><br>Another fun-fuelled activity to add to your list of things to do in Lake Atitlan is renting a stand-up paddleboard and cruising out into the middle of the lake.<br><br>SUP boards can typically be rented from the same place as you rent kayaks down by the main pier in San Pedro or from the main pier in the other villages.<br>While paddling on the lake, you get a 360 degree view of all the volcanoes, mountains and villages surrounding the lake. The feeling is truly surreal. <img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQ01_7oh8mRDHWO0_85MjjDI3KHq9bpkJLZOg&usqp=CAU"alt="image of a woman on paddle board doiing yoga on the lake"width="300">

      <p class="hi" id="spanish">TAKE SPANISH CLASSES</p><p>One of the most popular things to do in Lake Atitlan is to sign up for Spanish classes. Guatemala is, in fact, the best place in Central America to learn Spanish. </p>
      <p class="hi" id="woman">VISIT THE WOMAN WEAVERS</p><img src="https://www.jonnymelon.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/lake-atitlan-guatemala-52-800x600.jpg"alt="image of women weavers"width="300"><p>In every village around the lake, you can find women weavers cooperative stores to get a closer look into the Mayan culture and the art of weaving. You can also take a 2-hour class for around 100 Quetzal and learn how to do back-strap weaving.<br><br>The most popular village to visit the women weavers is in San Juan, a short 5-minute boat ride across the lake from San Pedro la Laguna. <br><br>Pop your head in, say hello, and take a few keepsake photos if anything.<br><img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTRatPBlWgRe5Q2dTpVd8UXJsEw9PCNAJtFpw&usqp=CAU"alt="image of a woman weaving"width="300"></p>

The guides are very affordable, and their knowledge of the area and the elements is worth the money. Most hiking tours include camping overnight so you can watch the sunrise and sunset at the top of the volcanoes.<br><br>As there are lots of tour companies and private local guides, just inquire at your hostel or with a tour company in whichever town you are staying in. San Pedro and Santiago Atitlán are the closest lakeside towns for hiking the volcanoes, but tour companies with hiking information reside in every town around Lake Atitlán.<br><br>For any hike up a volcano, it is always recommended to bring warm clothing as the temperature can drop at the high altitudes. Especially if you are camping overnight, pack clothing for all weather conditions. Guides will usually have first aid and camping gear with them, just be responsible for packing your own suitable clothes.<img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRXWl8OcSK-AXFG9fo6-Yw3vFKGoVeGhzsTzw&usqp=CAU"alt="image of volcanoes"width="300"></p>
      <p class="hi" id="explore">EXPLORE THE NATURE RESERVE</p>
      <p>If you're traveling alone in Lake Atitlan, spending time in the Nature Reserve is a great way to deepen your solo travel experience. <br><br> Located just outside Panajachel, the Atitlán Nature Reserve (Reserva Natural Atitlán) is the perfect place for nature lovers and explorers.<br><br>One of the attractions inside is a Butterfly Geodome, which helps butterflies grow and thrive in a safe environment.
